# TNoodle Web UI

A web ui for TNoodle that uses modern technology, and interacts with the WCA website api
to minimize repeated data entry.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

- `yarn install` - Install dependencies.
- `yarn start` - Starts a server accessible at http://localhost:3001/.
- `yarn build` - Compiles to `build/` directory.

## TODO

- warning when using outdated version of tnoodle
- copies input? save back to big json?
- refresh token?
